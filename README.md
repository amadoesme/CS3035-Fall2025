# CS3035 â€“ Programming Paradigms

This repo contains assignments and notes from my Programming Paradigms course at Cal State LA. We're exploring imperative, procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming using Python, C, and Kotlin.

## Languages
- **C**: Procedural, memory management, pointers
- **Python**: Multi-paradigm, functional tools
- **Kotlin**: Object-oriented, functional features

## Environment
- Coding in **Ubuntu Linux**
- Using **terminal** and **text editor** (no IDEs)

## Contents
- Annotated code examples
- Reflection notes connecting work to textbook concepts
- Study guides and reference sheets

## Goals
Write clean, well-documented code and understand how different paradigms shape problem-solving.
